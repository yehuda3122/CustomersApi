A clean and modular server-side implementation in .NET Core, designed with a layered architecture for maintainability and scalability.
This repository follows best practices for separation of concerns, leveraging dependency injection, repository patterns, and DTO-based communication between layers.
Includes support for multiple data sources, flexible service resolution at runtime, and JSON-based persistence for rapid prototyping.
Ideal as a foundation for enterprise-grade REST APIs with clear structure and testability in mind.
